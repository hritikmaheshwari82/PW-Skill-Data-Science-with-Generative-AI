        "**Answer:**  \n",
        "The **Curse of Dimensionality** refers to the problems that arise when data has a **large number of features (dimensions)**. As the number of dimensions increases, the data becomes **sparse**, distances between points become **less meaningful**, and models that rely on distance measures—like **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**—suffer in performance.\n",

        "\n",
        "## What Happens in High Dimensions\n",
        "1. **Data Sparsity:**  \n",
        "   - In high-dimensional spaces, data points are far apart and the notion of “closeness” becomes weak.  \n",
        "   - Most data points appear to be at almost the same distance from each other.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Distance Measures Lose Meaning:**  \n",
        "   - In high dimensions, the difference between the nearest and farthest neighbors becomes very small.  \n",
        "   - This makes it difficult for KNN to find truly “nearest” neighbors.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Increased Computation:**  \n",

        "- **Overfitting Risk:**  \n",
        "  - With too many irrelevant or noisy features, KNN may misclassify because every point starts looking equally close.  \n",
